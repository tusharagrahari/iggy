/**
 * A topic as the server reports it.
 *
 * <p>{@code options} carries the keys the creating client set explicitly;
 * {@code derivedOptions} carries the values admission resolved for the keys it did not.
 * Both are keyed by option name, and the split is the provenance: a value in
 * {@code derivedOptions} would have resolved differently under another server config.
 * The fixed fields above repeat three of those keys and stay for compatibility.
 *
 * <p>Both transports populate them. The binary protocol carries each value in the kind the server
 * stored it under; REST renders values in a readable string form, so over HTTP every value is
 * String-kinded.
