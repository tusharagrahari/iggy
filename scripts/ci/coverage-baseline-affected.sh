# Decide which coverage-baseline jobs a master push needs. Every Codecov flag
# has carryforward enabled, so a language whose sources did not change keeps
# serving its previous master report; only changed surfaces are re-measured.
#
# Fail-open: on any uncertainty (initial push, force push, unknown base) emit
# true for every gate so a needed refresh is never skipped. workflow_dispatch
# passes an empty base and lands on that path by design (manual full backfill).
#
# Usage:  coverage-baseline-affected.sh <base-sha> <head-sha>
# Output: one "<gate>=true|false" line per gate on stdout, shaped for
#         appending to $GITHUB_OUTPUT. Diagnostics go to stderr.
