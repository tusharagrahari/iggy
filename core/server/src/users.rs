//! User password-hashing request rewriting.
//!
//! Passwords arrive raw on the wire. The metadata STM stores
//! `CreateUserRequest::password` / `ChangePasswordRequest::new_password`
//! verbatim as the credential hash, and login verifies against it with
//! Argon2, so the stored value must already be a PHC hash. Hashing inside
//! the replicated `apply` would call `OsRng` for the Argon2 salt on every
//! replica and diverge state (and a raw password would never parse,
//! panicking `verify_password`). So the primary hashes once here and
//! replicates the hash, mirroring the PAT mint in [`crate::pat`].
//!
//! `ChangePassword` also verifies the caller-supplied `current_password`
//! against the target's stored hash before the op replicates (the legacy
//! server does this for self- and admin-initiated changes alike), and it
//! always empties that field, so no plaintext credential ever rides the
//! replicated prepare/WAL. A mismatch is committed as a rejecting no-op
//! (signalled by an empty new password) rather than denied pre-consensus, so
//! the caller's request sequence stays contiguous; see
//! `verify_and_rewrite_change_password`.

/// it in the replicated `ClientTable`, so a retry of that id would re-execute
/// instead of deduping. Instead the new password is emptied, which signals the
/// committed apply to reject with `InvalidCredentials` (a committed no-op that
/// advances the watermark).
///
/// Either way the current password is stripped and the accepted new one hashed,
/// so no plaintext credential ever enters consensus. An unresolved target keeps
/// its hashed new password and the replicated apply rejects it with
/// `UserNotFound`. ACCEPTED RESIDUAL: if the target is created in the narrow
/// window between this rewrite and the apply, the current-password check is
/// skipped for that one op; RBAC still gates cross-user changes. Concurrent
/// same-user `ChangePassword` ops each verify against the hash read here, so
/// the last to commit wins over a now-stale predecessor; there is no
/// compare-and-swap, which is benign and inherent to distributed submission.
