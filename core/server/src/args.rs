    long_about = r#"Apache Iggy - a persistent message streaming platform written in Rust

Iggy stores every stream in a replicated log kept consistent by Viewstamped
Replication. One binary serves both the single-node and the clustered
deployment; the loaded configuration decides which one you get.

WEBSITE:
    https://iggy.apache.org

REPOSITORY:
    https://github.com/apache/iggy

DOCUMENTATION:
    https://iggy.apache.org/docs

CONFIGURATION:
    The server reads a TOML configuration file, by default 'core/server/config.toml'
    resolved against the current working directory. Point IGGY_CONFIG_PATH at
    another file to override it.

    Examples:
        iggy-server                                    # Default config file
        IGGY_CONFIG_PATH=custom.toml iggy-server       # Custom config file path

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
    Any configuration value can be overridden with an IGGY_ prefixed variable;
    underscores separate the nested keys (IGGY_TCP_ADDRESS sets [tcp] address).
    A '.env' file in the working directory is loaded during startup, or the one
    named by IGGY_ENV_PATH.

    Common examples:
        IGGY_SYSTEM_PATH=/data/iggy                    # Data directory
        IGGY_TCP_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8090                  # TCP listener address
        IGGY_HTTP_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:3000                 # HTTP listener address
        IGGY_SYSTEM_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug                # Log level
        IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME=iggy                        # Root user, set with the password
        IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret                      # Root password, set with the username

TRANSPORT PROTOCOLS:
    - TCP (binary protocol)                            (default: 127.0.0.1:8090)
    - QUIC                                             (default: 127.0.0.1:8080)
    - WebSocket                                        (default: 127.0.0.1:8092)
    - HTTP (REST API)                                  (default: 127.0.0.1:3000)

GETTING STARTED:
    1. Start the server: iggy-server --fresh --with-default-root-credentials
    2. Install the CLI:  cargo install iggy-cli
    3. Create a stream:  iggy stream create my-stream
    4. Create a topic:   iggy topic create my-stream my-topic 1 none
    5. Send messages:    echo "Hello, Iggy!" | iggy message send my-stream my-topic

CLUSTER:
    Every node runs the same configuration file with cluster.enabled = true and
    is told apart only by --replica-id, which selects its own cluster.nodes entry:

        iggy-server --replica-id 0
