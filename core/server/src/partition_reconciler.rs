//! Partition reconciliation loop.
//!
//! One task per shard. On wake (commit tick or periodic safety tick),
//! diff committed `Streams` STM against local `IggyPartitions`:
//! - non-owned namespaces: seed `shards_table` row pointing at owner.
//! - owned namespaces: `build_partition_fresh` then enqueue
//!   `ReconcileOp::InsertOwned` for pump-side apply.
//! - ghosts: two-phase tombstone, disk delete, `ConfirmRemove`.
//!
//! # Materialisation race: the reply ships before the partition exists
//!
//! `metadata::on_ack` fires the commit notifier and emits the wire reply
//! immediately after STM apply, but the owning shard's reconciler wakes
//! asynchronously and only enqueues `ReconcileOp::InsertOwned` once
//! `build_partition_fresh` finishes (mkdir + segment open + fallocate,
//! multi-millisecond). A client that produces the instant `create_topic`
//! returns therefore races the partition into existence, on every shard at
//! once.
//!
//! The race is closed at the **owning shard**, not by the routing table:
//!
//! - `router::route_typed` treats a missing row as "not seeded yet", not
//!   "unroutable", and falls back to `calculate_shard_assignment`. The frame
//!   always reaches the shard that will own the partition.
//! - `IggyShard::park_if_unmaterialised` holds it there until the matching
//!   `InsertOwned` lands, then re-queues it onto this shard's inbox -- but not to
//!   a DIFFERENT incarnation than the one it was addressed to. Each parked frame
//!   carries the committed `created_revision` observed when it was parked, and a
//!   drain whose epoch disagrees with that stamp answers the client instead of
//!   serving it: recycled slab keys make the namespace byte-identical, so such a
//!   frame would otherwise land a dead topic's write inside the topic that
//!   replaced it. One gap, recorded below: the stamp is re-derived if the frame
//!   re-enters the park path from the inbox. A frame parked with NO stamp is
//!   served; see `redispatch_parked_frames` for why a missing committed revision
//!   is not evidence of a prior incarnation. Re-queuing appends, so a parked
//!   frame is ordered behind whatever is already in the inbox. A frame the inbox
//!   refuses is re-parked rather than answered, since the deny would ride the
//!   same full sender, and the pump re-drives it (`retry_reparked_frames`) once
//!   a slot frees.
//! - `IggyShard::serves_committed_incarnation` refuses a namespace whose
//!   committed `created_revision` disagrees with the epoch on the local row, so
//!   a request arriving mid-teardown cannot be acked against the incarnation
//!   teardown is about to erase. It discriminates the shard's own state, not the
//!   frame's provenance, which is why the park stamp above is separate.
//! - Nothing is left unanswered: a tombstoned namespace, an overflowing park
//!   buffer, and a namespace this shard has given up materialising
//!   ([`reconcile_parked_frames`]) all reply with a retriable status, so a
//!   lockstep transport never waits out its read timeout on silence.
//!
//! `shards_table` is therefore a **cache of a deterministic hash**, never a
//! readiness proof: every shard derives the same rows from the same committed
//! metadata, and a row may exist before its partition does. Nothing may treat
//! presence as "the owner is ready" - `dispatch::wait_for_partition_routable`
//! documents why the owner-readiness probe that used to live there was both
//! unnecessary and ineffective.
//!
//! Keeping the table a hint is what makes it repairable: a pass that runs
//! re-derives the full row set from committed metadata, so a lost row is
//! rewritten. Note the qualifier -- the revision fast-skip below returns before
//! reading `shards_table` at all, so repair is driven by the signals that defeat
//! that skip (a partition-shaping commit, a pending retry, unfinished work, a
//! non-empty park buffer), not by every tick. An earlier design made the owner the sole writer and pushed
//! rows to peers to promote presence into a materialisation proof; it bought
//! nothing the owner-side fences above do not already guarantee, and it traded
//! that level-triggered repair for cross-core delta propagation that has to be
//! ordered, retried, and repaired to stay correct.
//!
//! Park residency is bounded on three axes, since the frame count alone bounds
//! nothing useful (`Message::into_generic` is a retag, so each entry keeps its
//! whole buffer, up to 64 MiB): a per-namespace frame cap, byte budgets per
//! namespace and per shard, and an age in reconciler passes.
//!
//! They apply asymmetrically, because the two frame classes fail differently. A
//! shed request costs a retry: answered with a retriable status, re-issued by
//! the SDK. A shed prepare is permanent loss on this replica, with no client to
//! answer and `consensus::retransmit_targets` skipping any op that already
//! reached quorum.
//!
//! All three bind a request: refused when admitting it would cross a byte budget
//! or the frame cap, answered past `MAX_PARKED_PASSES`. Only the byte budgets
//! bind a prepare, and only once one is spent. Excluding the frame cap is
//! deliberate: a header-only frame charges `MESSAGE_ALIGN`, so 128 is 512 KiB
//! against a 4 MiB namespace budget, and a shared cap would shed small prepares
//! before any byte budget spoke. Prepares admit 1024 header-only frames per
//! namespace, overshooting each budget by one frame rather than stopping at it,
//! which also makes an oversize frame parkable: against an empty entry a 5 MiB
//! append fails the per-namespace check every attempt. A parked prepare dies only
//! for a namespace this shard cannot serve, tombstoned or not hashing here.
//!
//! Everything leaving the buffer unserved is counted under
//! `frame_drops_total{variant=partition}`: `park_overflow` when shed on arrival,
//! `park_dropped` when it parked and then lost its namespace. A prepare has
//! nobody to answer, so the counter is the only record it existed.
//!
//! # Known gaps
//!
//! Recorded here because both were previously carried as a TODO on the
//! materialization barrier this module used to promise, and the barrier is gone
//! (see above) while these are not:
//!
//! TODO(krishna): a shed or discarded *prepare* has no recovery once its op has
//! reached quorum. `consensus::retransmit_targets` skips entries with
//! `ok_quorum_received`, and the partition plane creates a repair session only
//! in `on_start_view` -- `tick_partitions` re-drives an existing session but
//! cannot open one -- so the backup stays behind `commit_max` until an unrelated
//! view change. It needs a normal-status repair driver. The park policy above
//! shrinks the exposure to two cases, a genuinely exhausted byte budget and a
//! namespace this shard cannot serve, but only the repair driver removes it.
//!
//! TODO(krishna): the park stamp is not stable across re-entry. A re-dispatched
//! frame still in the inbox when a delete + recreate completes (`ConfirmRemove`
//! removes and untombstones in one arm, then the rebuild lands) re-enters
//! `park_if_unmaterialised` and is re-stamped with the NEW revision and
//! `passes: 0`, then served against the replacement: the write the stamp exists
//! to block. Narrow (a full delete + recreate has to finish while one frame
//! waits), but the guarantee is not absolute the way the bullet above reads.
//! Closing it needs the frame to carry provenance through the inbox instead of
//! re-deriving it on arrival.
//!
//! TODO(krishna): re-dispatch APPENDS to the inbox, so a parked prepare loses its
//! arrival position. `router.rs`'s `select_biased!` puts the consensus tick (which
//! runs `apply_reconcile_ops`, and with it the re-dispatch) above the inbox arm,
//! so a parked op N is re-queued *behind* an op N+1 that was already sitting in
//! the inbox. The partition plane then sees N+1 first, rejects it against its
//! backup gap check, and N+1 is gone -- with no normal-status repair driver to
//! refetch it (see the TODO above). Ordering has to be restored at the plane, by
//! buffering out-of-order prepares rather than dropping them, or by re-dispatching
//! through a priority path that preserves op order.
//!
//! TODO(krishna): `serves_committed_incarnation` and the park stamp both call
//! `Streams::created_revision_for_namespace`, now on the per-request fence path.
//! It indexes directly and falls back to a scan only if partition ids are not
//! dense, so the common case is O(1) -- but nothing in the type enforces that
//! density, and a future sparse layout silently reverts every fenced request to a
//! full scan. It wants a partition-id-keyed map in the STM.
//!
//! TODO(krishna): the transient deny answers with `IggyError::TransientNotAccepted`,
//! which the SDK treats as a leader-liveness signal. It replays same-session for
//! its `transient_deadline` first -- which is the right response and usually long
//! enough for the namespace to materialise -- but past that deadline `tcp_client`
//! runs `handle_leader_redirection` and reconnects, re-registering and losing the
//! session. Every cause of a park deny is node-local convergence, so that failover
//! cannot help; it needs a distinct "retry here shortly" code that does not move
//! the client.
//!
//! TODO(krishna): replicated traffic is deliberately exempt from the incarnation
//! fence, since a backup must apply whatever the primary admitted.
//! `PrepareHeader` carries no incarnation, so a backup still holding a prior one
//! cannot tell that an arriving prepare belongs to its replacement. Parked
//! prepares are covered by the epoch stamp above; one arriving against an
//! already-materialised stale incarnation is not. Closing it needs a wire-level
//! discriminator, like `checkpoint_id` on every prepare
//! -- `PrepareHeader.reserved` has room, but it is a `#[repr(C)]` wire change.
