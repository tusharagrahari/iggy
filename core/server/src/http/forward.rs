//! Follower-side forwarding of consensus-needing requests to the VSR
//! metadata primary.
//!
//! A load balancer that round-robins HTTP across the cluster lands writes and
//! linearizable reads on followers, which cannot serve them: a follower can
//! neither Register a VSR session nor commit a control-plane op. Instead of
//! failing those requests with a transient 503, the middleware here re-issues
//! them against the current primary's HTTP listener and relays the primary's
//! response on the original connection, so any node answers any request.
//!
//! Scope: the middleware is attached (via `route_layer`) only to the
//! control-plane routes, whose ops all commit through the metadata consensus
//! group and therefore share one forward target. Partition-plane writes
//! (produce, consumer-offset writes) are excluded: each partition is its own
//! consensus group whose primary can diverge from the metadata primary, so
//! forwarding them needs per-group target resolution.
//!
//! Safety model, in order:
//! - The bearer is verified locally (verify-only, no session mint) before any
//!   bytes leave this node, so an unauthenticated caller cannot make a
//!   follower relay junk to the primary. A PAT is checked against this node's
//!   local metadata view, so a PAT minted on the primary and not yet
//!   replicated here answers 401 until replication catches up - fail-closed
//!   on purpose, the price of keeping the pre-forward auth gate.
//! - The primary re-authenticates and re-authorizes the forwarded request
//!   through its ordinary extractor stack; the forward marker header is a loop
//!   guard only and never a trust input.
//! - A forwarded request is retried only when it provably never entered the
//!   primary's pipeline: a connect-phase failure, a 503 whose body carries the
//!   `TransientNotAccepted` code, or a 307 from a stale target. Every other
//!   outcome - including a 503 carrying `TransientNotCommitted`, whose op may
//!   still commit - is relayed as-is, because re-issuing it under a fresh
//!   session would defeat the consensus dedup and double-apply the op.
//! - The target is always resolved from the local roster + consensus view,
//!   never from a response `Location`, and the client follows no redirects.
