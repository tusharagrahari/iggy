//! Consensus group-id packing constants.
//!
//! Clients send no group or namespace at all -- the server derives the
//! target from the operation and the request payload, stamps it into
//! `RoutedRequestHeader.group` at the dispatch boundary, and every internal
//! layer (sharding hash, consensus demux, repair replay) routes on that
//! stamped value. How stream/topic/partition triples pack into the `u64`
//! is therefore a server-side agreement between the resolver and the
//! sharding layer; the single source of truth lives here in the wire-format
//! crate both already depend on.
