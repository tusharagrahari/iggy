/// remove, reorder, retype, or redefine the meaning of any field, at any depth
/// under [`MetadataSnapshot`]. There is no accepted range and no per-version
/// translation. A snapshot this build cannot read is refused, not best-effort
/// decoded.
///
/// Nothing softer would hold. msgpack encodes a struct positionally, so a field one
/// build appends reaches another as an unexplained extra array element; without the
/// version the reader either fails on an unrelated msgpack error or, for a
/// same-length change, silently reads one field's bytes as another's.
///
/// Bumping it invalidates every `snapshot.bin` already on disk, and a node whose
/// snapshot is refused refuses boot. That is deliberate. The metadata plane is
/// pre-production, so the cost is clearing a data directory; once it ships, a bump
/// needs an explicit translation path added here alongside it.
///
/// Version 2: `status` sits at reply-header offset 216 (version 1 carried a
/// `namespace` word before it), which the client table's cached replies embed as raw
/// wire bytes msgpack cannot introspect.
///
/// Version 3: `TopicSnapshot` dropped `replication_factor` from the middle of the
/// struct and gained `options`. Both changes land in the same element count, so a
/// version 2 file decoded under this shape does not fail cleanly: msgpack reads the
/// old `replication_factor` byte as `message_expiry` and walks every later field one
