//! Checkpoint-shaped edge cases for metadata + client-table state transfer,
//! metadata-plane commands only (`CreateStream`). The 3-node cases drive the
//! raw VSR wire; the solo case at the bottom uses the regular TCP client.
//!
//! `metadata_state_transfer` pins the base case: one checkpoint, a live
//! post-checkpoint tail, one restart. This file covers the shapes around it:
//!
//! - restart exactly AT a checkpoint (snapshot present, post-snapshot journal
//!   empty), so the transfer installs snapshot-only and the tail repair has
//!   nothing to fetch;
//! - restart after MULTIPLE checkpoint generations (`snapshot.bin` was
//!   rewritten in place; only the latest generation may be served);
//! - a below-floor dedup retry after the restart, answered byte-identically
//!   from the TRANSFERRED reply ring - the WAL entry that produced the reply
//!   was drained on every node, so nothing but the shipped table can answer;
//! - a second restart of the same node (the installed snapshot must persist
//!   and serve as the local floor for another transfer round);
//! - a SOLO replica restarting after its own checkpoint: no transfer in the
//!   picture, so recovery has to fold the local snapshot back in as the floor
//!   and replay the WAL suffix on top.
//!
//! Checkpoint placement in the 3-node cases is config-driven: with
//! `metadata.journal_slots = 256` and the built-in checkpoint margin (64), a
//! checkpoint fires when the journal holds 192 committed ops, i.e. at op 192,
//! 384, ... The register commits at op 1 and request K at op K + 1, so request
//! 191 lands checkpoint one and request 383 lands checkpoint two. Requests
//! here are sequential with one in flight, which keeps that arithmetic exact;
//! the `forced checkpoint completed` markers below pin it rather than trust
//! it.
