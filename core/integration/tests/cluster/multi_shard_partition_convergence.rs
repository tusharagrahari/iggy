//! Partition convergence across shards on one node.
//!
//! `create_topic` returns on metadata commit, before the owning shard has run
//! `build_partition_fresh`, so a produce issued immediately after races
//! materialisation. Nothing about that race is resolved on the shard the client
//! is connected to: `shards_table` is a cache of the deterministic hash
//! assignment and may hold a row before the partition exists. The owning shard
//! resolves it, by parking the frame until its partition lands
//! (`park_if_unmaterialised`) and by fencing a mismatched incarnation
//! (`serves_committed_incarnation`), answering anything it cannot yet serve
//! with a retriable status the SDK replays.
//!
//! Forcing two shards is the point. Existing coverage of these fences is
//! single-shard, where the shard that admits the request is also the one that
//! owns the partition, so the cross-core path never runs: the hash fallback in
//! `router::route_typed`, the frame crossing into a peer's inbox, and that
//! peer's park queue draining on its own pump. Roughly half of the topics below
//! hash to a shard other than the one homing the connection.
//!
//! That split is a murmur3 outcome and is invisible from here -- this test would
//! stay green while silently degrading to single-shard if the hash or the shard
//! count changed. It is pinned instead where the assignment is a pure function,
//! by `partition_reconciler::tests::integration_topic_set_straddles_both_shards`,
//! which asserts over the same namespaces this test creates. Change the topic
//! count or the stream here and that guard has to move with it.
//!
//! Scope, stated plainly: this is a convergence test, not a barrier test. It
//! cannot tell a request served straight through from one that parked and was
//! re-dispatched, so it does not pin *which* mechanism carried it. What it does
//! catch is that mechanism failing outright -- a frame that never reaches the
//! owner, a park queue that never drains, or a fence that denies forever --
//! since every one of those surfaces as a failed send or a short poll.
