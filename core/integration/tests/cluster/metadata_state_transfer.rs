//! Spec test for metadata state transfer: a node that restarts into a live
//! cluster replaces its snapshot-shaped state (metadata snapshot + client
//! table) from the current primary instead of relying on its own WAL.
//!
//! The scenario forces the interesting case: enough committed metadata ops
//! to trip a checkpoint on every node (`journal_slots` shrunk below), which
//! drains the early ops -- including the client's register -- out of every
//! WAL. A restarted node's local recovery can then neither replay those ops
//! nor journal-repair them (the serving peers evicted them too); only the
//! transferred snapshot + table carry that history.
//!
//! The transferred node is a follower afterwards, so its installed state has
//! no client-visible surface to assert against (followers neither commit nor
//! serve resume lookups). The install is pinned via its log marker; the
//! functional assert (post-restart continuation commits cluster-wide) rides
//! on top.
