//! Partition-plane state transfer: a rejoining replica whose journal repair
//! cannot close the gap (the peer's evicted ring moved past it) pulls the
//! partition's retained segments + consumer offsets from the caught-up
//! primary, installs them, and hands the live tail to ordinary repair.
//!
//! Forcing function: `messages_required_to_save = 1` flushes (and ring-
//! evicts) every committed batch, and `evicted_ring_capacity = 64` keeps the
//! repair window shallow, so ~200 produced batches push `repair_retained_from`
//! far past a rejoiner's durable end. Its gap-fill repair then gets
//! `RangeEvicted`, the repaired window cannot connect to recovered state,
//! and `complete_repair` returns the `FloorRefused` conversion trigger.
