//! Spec tests for clients-table durability across a node restart (IGGY-137).
//!
//! A client that keeps its `(client, session, request)` identity across a
//! node crash must be able to continue: a retry of an already-committed
//! request id must be answered from the dedup cache (never re-applied,
//! never silently dropped), and the next request id must be admitted.
//!
//! Server-side this rests on three landed pieces:
//!
//! 1. WAL-replay table recovery: `metadata::impls::recovery::recover`
//!    replays registers (minting the same epochs) and re-caches committed
//!    replies byte-identically, so a rebooted node remembers where each
//!    client left off. Sessions whose register fell below the snapshot
//!    floor are not recovered yet (no checkpoint artifact - IGGY-137
//!    remainder).
//! 2. Resume through the login path: a reconnecting client re-authenticates
//!    presenting its previous `client_id`. The rebind commits a Register --
//!    `submit_register_in_process` verifies the authenticated user owns the
//!    entry, then proposes -- so the entry's fence moves to the new register's
//!    commit op while keeping its watermark and reply ring. The client
//!    continues under the NEW epoch from the login reply; frames stamped with
//!    the pre-restart epoch are fenced zombies. There is deliberately no
//!    credential-free rebind; `given_live_session_when_unauthenticated_peer_*`
//!    pins that.
//! 3. A crash leaves no `Logout` behind. Every transport disconnect releases
//!    its session (`submit_disconnect_logout`), so what makes the entry
//!    survivable is that the process died with the connection still open --
//!    hence these tests restart before closing the socket. Holding the slot
//!    open past a graceful disconnect would make resume work there too, but
//!    it needs a timer of its own; see that function's rustdoc.
//!
//! The Rust SDK cannot drive this yet: it resets its `ConsensusSession` on
//! every disconnect and re-registers under a fresh identity (the
//! `sdk/vsr.rs` retry TODO). The frames are therefore hand-crafted on a raw
//! TCP socket, same technique as the protocol-version gate tests. SDK-side
//! identity stability (keep client id + request counter across reconnects,
//! retry replicated writes only under the same identity) is the remaining
//! client half.
//!
//! The topology matrix covers two distinct recovery paths:
//!
//! - **1 node**: the restarted node rebuilds the table from its own WAL and
//!   the client resumes against it (restart recovery).
//! - **3 nodes**: `restart_server` reboots node 0 only; the survivors elect
//!   a new primary, whose table was maintained by its own `commit_journal`
//!   applies all along. The client resumes against whichever node answers
//!   as primary — a follower cannot commit replicated TCP writes (no
//!   follower forwarding for TCP yet), so the continuation loop probes
//!   every node the way a leader-aware SDK re-routes (failover resume).
//!
//! These tests pin the resume contract: a client re-authenticates on the
//! fresh connection under its old `client_id` and the server binds it back to
//! the recovered entry rather than minting a new one. If the session-resume
//! work later settles on an explicit resume handshake, adjust `resume_request`
//! to speak it -- but it must stay credential-bearing.
