//! Adversarial specs against the VSR client table's at-most-once guarantees.
//!
//! Both assert the dedup contract a retrying client needs at the table's two
//! resource edges. The capacity one now passes; the reply-ring one is still a
//! RED SPEC, expected to FAIL.
//!
//! 1. Capacity: a full table evicts the entry with the oldest commit. Eviction
//!    keeps that client's request watermark (and the watermark's reply when the
//!    ring still held it), so a client that was merely quiet re-registers and
//!    its retry of an already-committed request id is answered, not re-executed.
//! 2. Reply ring: each entry retains only its `REPLY_RING_CAPACITY` most
//!    recent committed replies. A retry of a request whose reply aged out is
//!    refused with the terminal `RequestAlreadyApplied` and no result payload,
//!    indistinguishable from a rejection to the caller.
//!
//! The frames are hand-crafted on raw TCP sockets, same technique and frame
//! builders as the clients-table restart tests, because the churn needs
//! per-connection client identities and byte-level replay the SDK does not
//! expose. The builders here are parameterized by client id, which is why the
//! restart tests' fixed-identity helpers are not reused directly.
