// `flush_unsaved_buffer`, which the server answers `FeatureUnavailable` and
// which the eager-flush server envs replace under vsr. The bench-fill test
// itself runs under vsr since PARTITION-plane state transfer landed, but the
// harness spawns `iggy-bench` off disk with no cargo build-graph edge, so the
// binary must be freshly built or a stale build hangs on login.
