//! Flush contract against the server (vsr): the server has no on-demand flush
//! primitive, so `FLUSH_UNSAVED_BUFFER` must surface a typed
//! `FeatureUnavailable` over the SDK rather than the non-replicated catch-all's
//! empty-ok, which would fake a durability guarantee.
//!
//! `FLUSH_UNSAVED_BUFFER` is slated for removal from the protocol. This test
//! pins the deny contract only until then: delete this file together with the
//! command (and the SDK method), do not port it anywhere.
