//! Metadata-plane view durability across a real view change and process restarts,
//! over `iggy-server`'s production superblock path.
//!
//! The superblock exists so a replica recovers a view it already acted in from its
//! OWN disk after a crash, instead of inferring a stale view from the WAL or
//! relearning it from a peer. That is the safety property stopping a recovered
//! replica from re-voting in an old view and splitting the log. This drives a genuine
//! metadata view change, crashing the view-0 primary so the survivors elect a new
//! one, then proves the elected view is durable: it lands in a survivor's on-disk
//! `VsrState` as `view` / `log_view >= 1` and survives that survivor's own process
//! restart. The stream committed before the crash comes back too, so metadata
//! op/commit recovery from the WAL rides along.
//!
//! The production counterpart to the simulator's
//! `given_advanced_view_when_metadata_replica_restarts_should_recover_view_from_superblock`,
//! which proves the same property over the in-memory `SimSuperblock`; this proves it
//! over the real `PingPongSuperblock` and `restore_metadata_consensus` the sim stubs
//! out.
//!
//! Deliberately metadata-only, a stream and no topic: a topic would create a
//! partition consensus group whose own view change is orthogonal to the plane under
//! test and would only add flakiness. Restarts keep a metadata quorum of 2 of 3 live
//! at every instant, bringing the crashed primary back before bouncing the survivor,
//! so recovery is exercised without wedging the cluster below quorum.
//!
//! vsr-only: a metadata view change has no analog on the single-process legacy
//! server, and the superblock is the server's durable consensus record.
