//! Partition-plane view durability across a real view change and process restarts,
//! over the per-partition `PingPongSuperblock` path.
//!
//! The partition-plane sibling of `cluster_view_durability_vsr`: every partition
//! consensus group now records its `(view, log_view)` in a superblock inside its own
//! partition directory, and every view-scoped send for that group is gated on the
//! record being durable. This drives a genuine partition view change, crashing the
//! view-0 primary so the survivors elect a new one, then proves the elected view is
//! durable on the PARTITION group's own record: it lands in a survivor's on-disk
//! `VsrState` as `view` / `log_view >= 1` and survives that survivor's own process
//! restart. Messages committed before the crash still poll back at the end, so the
//! partition data path rides along.
//!
//! vsr-only: partition consensus groups and their superblocks exist only on
//! `iggy-server`.
