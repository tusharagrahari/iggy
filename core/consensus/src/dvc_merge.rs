//! Merging a `DoViewChange` quorum into the new view's log: for every op that
//! might be uncommitted, does the new view keep it or discard it?
//!
//! Keeping an op that was never committed costs a wasted slot. Discarding one
//! that WAS committed loses acknowledged client data, so the only proof accepted
//! for discarding is a nack quorum: enough replicas stating they never prepared
//! it that a replication quorum provably never formed. Absent that the op is
//! kept, and if no replica offers its body the view does not start. Stalling is
//! visible and recoverable; losing the op is neither.
