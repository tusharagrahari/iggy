///   committed register (`TigerBeetle`'s "the commit number becomes the session
///   number"). Register only commits in the metadata group, so the fence has
///   one minting authority and stays comparable in any consensus group's
///   slice; being log-derived it never regresses, even across entry drop and
///   re-create.
/// - **Watermark, not contiguity.** A request above the watermark executes
///   (gaps allowed); at or below is a duplicate. There is no `RequestGap`:
///   a client that jumps its counter loses nothing but the skipped ids.
/// - **Replies are volatile.** A small per-entry ring of recent replies
///   (latest at the back), all in-memory refcounts. A duplicate whose reply
///   aged out is still refused execution ([`RequestStatus::AlreadyApplied`]).
///
/// ## Plane
///
/// Metadata-plane today. The design spans planes (one logical table,
/// group-resident slices); partition-plane integration arrives once
/// partition prepares carry real `(session_id, request)` instead of the
/// transport id (data-plane request numbering, IGGY-137). Until then the
/// partition plane stays at-least-once with no dedup.
///
/// ## Tracking
///
/// Committed state only. In-flight state (acks, subscribers, in-progress
/// dedup) lives on [`crate::PipelineEntry`]. Updated by `commit_reply` /
/// `commit_register` in the apply path, so every replica of the group
/// derives an identical table from the committed log.
///
/// ## Durability
///
/// [`Self::to_snapshot`] / [`Self::from_snapshot`] fold the table into the
/// metadata checkpoint, so sessions registered below the snapshot floor survive
/// a restart that drained the WAL prefix they committed in.
///
/// ## Serialization (wire)
///
/// [`Self::encode`] / [`Self::decode`] carry the table across state transfer
/// (a rejoin behind the peers' retained floor replaces its table with the
/// primary's copy). Deterministic: slot-order walk over apply-derived state,
/// so every caught-up replica encodes identical bytes. Distinct from the
