//! Single-shard async gate for critical sections that hold across an `.await`.
//!
//! Many futures can drive the same shard-local resource concurrently (a pump
//! loop, detached per-client tasks, repair drivers). This gate serializes them
//! without atomics: the shard is never `Sync`, so a `Cell` flag provides the
//! exclusion a `tokio::sync::Mutex` would buy with an atomic RMW per acquire.
//!
//! Not a general lock: single-threaded (`Cell`/`RefCell`, never `Sync`),
//! release wakes every waiter and poll order re-races (arrival-order FIFO
//! under `futures::join!`-style drivers), cancel-safe (dropping the guard
//! releases; dropping a waiter leaves only a stale waker). Non-reentrant: a
//! holder that re-acquires deadlocks itself.

/// See the module docs. Callers hold the returned guard across the awaited
/// critical section; dropping it releases the gate and wakes every waiter.

/// single-writer contract there. The `WritingGuard` tripwire is debug-only,
/// `PingPongSuperblock::write` takes `&self`, and two overlapping writers
/// collide on one fixed `.tmp` path and tear a slot while both return `Ok`.
