//! Durable superblock: a small record that survives a crash intact.
//!
//! Persists the VSR state consensus cannot recover from its own disk
//! (`view`, `log_view`, `commit`). The payload is opaque here: this layer
//! makes N bytes durable and picks the latest good copy, nothing more.
//! Consensus owns their meaning.
//!
//! [`PingPongSuperblock`] writes two files alternately, higher valid
//! `sequence` wins, each replaced by writing a temp, fsyncing it, renaming it
//! over the target, then fsyncing the directory (as `PrepareJournal` does for
//! WAL compaction). Rename is atomic, so a torn write dies in the temp while
//! the other file stays an intact prior generation: an update can never destroy
//! the last good record.
//!
//! By that same atomicity, a slot holding bytes that fail verification is bit-rot
//! of a once-durable record, not an interrupted write. Its `sequence` is
//! unreadable, so it may be the NEWER generation, and reading through it would
//! hand consensus an older `view` / `log_view` than it already acted on. Such a
//! slot yields [`SuperblockContents::Unreadable`] and blocks writes, so the next
//! `write` cannot stamp a fresh sequence over the evidence.
//!
//! The record already carries the `version`, `sequence`, and
//! `parent_checksum` an N-copy in-place quorum variant would need, so that
//! migration stays contained to a second `impl SuperblockStore`.

// Every future here drives compio single-threaded file I/O and is `!Send` by
// construction, like the sibling `FileStorage`/`PrepareJournal`.
