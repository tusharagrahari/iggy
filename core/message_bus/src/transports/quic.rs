//! QUIC impls of the [`super`] transport traits.
//!
//! SDK-client plane only; replica plane stays TCP-only.
//! `compio-quic` binds `quinn-proto` natively to the compio runtime,
//! so no tokio bridge.
//!
//! # Connection model
//!
//! One bidirectional stream **per request** (matches the iggy SDK QUIC
//! client, which opens a fresh `open_bi` per command and `send.finish()`-s
//! after writing the request). The transport's [`QuicTransportConn::run`]
//! runs an outer `accept_bi` loop on the connection and serves one bidi
//! at a time:
//!
//! 1. accept the next bidi (or break on shutdown / connection close);
//! 2. read exactly one inbound frame from the `RecvStream`, note its
//!    `request` id, and forward it to [`ActorContext::in_tx`];
//! 3. wait on [`ActorContext::rx`] for the reply whose `request` id matches,
//!    discarding any stale/duplicate reply left by an earlier attempt's bidi
//!    (the SDK replays an explicit transient with the SAME request id); write
//!    the matched reply, then `finish()` to deliver pending data + FIN;
//! 4. drop the bidi pair and loop to the next `accept_bi`.
//!
//! The `accept_bi` loop is serial (the iggy SDK serialises per connection via
//! an internal `RwLock`, so one bidi at a time is a semantic match) and the
//! reply wait is `request_id`-KEYED. The wait is NOT bounded by a short
//! abandon-timeout: every transient submit is answered with an explicit
//! `TransientNotCommitted` rejection frame these days, so an unanswered bidi
//! means the dispatch truly dropped the request (both partition queues full)
//! or the op is pathologically slow -- and abandoning the bidi while the op
//! can still commit would strand its reply. All partition ops on a
//! connection share ONE request id (only metadata ops advance the dedup
//! counter), so a stranded reply would be consumed by the NEXT partition
//! op's bidi and shift the connection's data-plane stream off by one,
//! permanently. Instead, `REPLY_WAIT_BACKSTOP` (longer than the SDK's
//! whole-request deadline, so the client always gives up first and
//! reconnects) closes the CONNECTION, which drops the mailbox and every
//! pending reply with it -- nothing can strand or cross request ids. A
//! future pipelining upgrade would additionally run per-bidi handlers
//! concurrently (and would then require a real per-op correlation id).
//!
//! The handshake itself is driven by [`accept_handshake`] (no bidi
//! captured). To avoid a single slow / hostile peer wedging the entire
//! client plane behind that handshake, the client listener's accept loop
//! pulls bare [`Incoming`] values via
//! [`QuicTransportListener::next_incoming`] and spawns one
//! `accept_handshake` task per incoming.
//!
//! # Zero-copy
//!
//! `compio_quic::SendStream::write<T: IoBuf>` accepts
//! `Frozen<MESSAGE_ALIGN>` directly; the per-bidi reply path issues one
//! `write` per frame (QUIC has no `sendmmsg` analog). Per-message
//! syscalls are the documented trade-off versus the TCP `writev` path;
//! small high-RPS workloads stay on TCP.
//!
//! # 0-RTT
//!
//! 0-RTT is off by default at the rustls layer (`max_early_data_size = 0`).
//! `RecvStream::is_0rtt()` is checked inside the `accept_bi` loop for
//! defense in depth; a `true` here closes the connection with
//! `QUIC_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`. Per-command 0-RTT enablement requires a
//! per-command idempotence audit before being turned on.
