//! Deterministic single-threaded cooperative executor.
//!
//! Holds many `!Send` futures (shard message pumps) on one thread and
//! preempts them only at their own await points. Whenever more than one task
//! is ready, the next task to poll is picked uniformly at random from a
//! PRNG seeded by the simulation seed, so the interleaving of shard tasks is
//! a pure, replayable function of that seed. Time is virtual: timers fire
//! only through [`DetExecutor::advance_time`], never from the wall clock.
//!
//! Re-entrancy is settled by ownership rather than runtime checks: waking a
//! task (including self-wakes and crossfire's inline wake-on-`try_send`)
//! only appends to a shared queue, while `spawn`/`abort`/`run_until_stalled`
//! need `&mut DetExecutor`, which task code can never hold. The simulator is
//! the only spawner.
