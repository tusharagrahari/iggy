//! Owned, borrow-free poll execution.
//!
//! A poll must not hold a partition reference across an `.await`: the shard pump
//! can reallocate the partitions `Vec` (`ReconcileOp::InsertOwned`) or take a
//! `&mut` to the same namespace while a poll is parked, dangling the reference.
//! So `IggyPartition::build_poll_plan` captures everything a poll needs
//! synchronously under the borrow into the owned types here, drops the borrow,
//! then [`PollPlan::execute`] runs the disk read + the in-memory auto-commit
//! apply on owned data alone: consumer offsets are already `Arc`, the journal
//! tail is a point-in-time `Frozen` snapshot, and each sealed segment carries a
//! shared [`SealedSegmentReadState`] handle (a plain `Rc`, not a partition
//! reference) whose read fd + sparse index the read reuses or fills on a miss.
//! No value in this module holds a partition reference, so executing a plan is
//! sound on a detached task concurrently with the pump's own writes.
