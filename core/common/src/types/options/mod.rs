//! Key-value options attached to streams, topics, and users at creation.
//!
//! Options reuse the typed [`HeaderKey`] / [`HeaderValue`] machinery from
//! message user headers. The map MUST stay a `BTreeMap`: metadata snapshots
//! require deterministic ordering across replicas, and a hash map would make
//! snapshot bytes diverge per replica.
//!
//! # SDK parity
//!
//! Every SDK can set any option key, read both blocks back, and ask the server
//! which keys it accepts. What differs is only how each language spells the
//! argument, since each reuses the type it already had for message user headers:
//!
//! | SDK    | Arbitrary keys on create/update      | Reads the blocks | `describe_options` |
//! |--------|--------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
//! | Rust   | `TopicCreateOptions::raw`            | yes              | yes                |
//! | Node   | `options?: OptionEntry[]`            | yes              | yes                |
//! | Python | `options=` string dict                | yes              | yes                |
//! | Go     | trailing `options ...HeaderEntry`    | yes              | yes                |
//! | Java   | `Map<String, HeaderValue>` overload  | yes              | yes                |
//! | C#     | optional `IReadOnlyDictionary`       | yes              | yes                |
//! | C++    | trailing `Vec<HeaderEntry>`          | yes              | yes                |
//!
//! One transport caveat everywhere: REST renders option values as readable
//! strings rather than the typed TLV, so a value read back over HTTP is
//! String-kinded while the same value over a binary transport carries the kind
//! the server stored. REST also reports both provenances in one map with a
//! per-entry flag, which each SDK splits into the two maps its binary path
//! produces.
//!
//! Beyond the eight typed keys, Go, Java, C# and C++ ship typed constructors or
//! builders for the five keys that have no named parameter of their own, so no
//! caller has to spell an option key as a bare string.
//!
//! The block's byte layout is pinned by a golden vector that Rust, Node, Go and
//! Java each assert independently, so a new encoder has a fixture to match
//! rather than a description to interpret.
